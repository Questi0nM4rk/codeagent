# Epic 8: Archive Old MCP Repos and Update Documentation

## Status: Not Started (blocked by Epic 6 + 7)

## Goal

Archive the 4 individual MCP repositories, update all documentation to reflect the unified system, and publish the codeagent package.

## Scope

- Archive repos: amem-mcp, reflection-mcp, codebase-mcp, backlog-mcp
- Update README with unified architecture
- Update CLAUDE.md files
- Publish codeagent to PyPI (or GitHub Packages)
- Update install.sh for single-MCP installation

## Depends On

- Epic 6 (unified MCP replaces individual repos)
- Epic 7 (skills/commands migrated to plugin format)

## Details

TBD after Epics 6 and 7 are complete.
